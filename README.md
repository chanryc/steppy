This is our project for Hack the Heights 2025!

## Inspiration
We wanted to encourage people to exercise; but more specifically to motivate people to do something engaging and explore the area around them. It takes a new approach to fitness and how it can be both entertaining while also good for the body!

## What it does
Our approach bridges fitness and technology with the usage of OpenAI API. It transforms walking into AI-driven adventure by using real-time data and GPS. 

## How we built it
We used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (Bootstrap) to build the website. We also utilized OpenAI API and leaflet.js (OpenStreetMap/Overpass) to generate functioning scavenger prompts. Leaflet.js was utilized to display the maps.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into numerous roadblocks along the way. We were unsure of our idea in the beginning, so it took a while to get started on the project. Once we started on the project, there were many practical issues that we faced, namely securing an OpenAI API. We have still yet to figure out that aspect of our project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learned how to apply our HTML, CSS, and Javascript knowledge to integrate APIs into our project. We initially didn't intend to use OpenAI API, however, along the way we figured that it would improve our idea. None of our members participated in a hackathon before, so we are extremely proud of our product and sticking through with the idea even though there were many obstacles.

## What we learned
We learned how to use APIs, as well as leaflet.js to include maps on our web application. 

## What's next for Steppy!
 There are many improvements that can be made for this project. As an expansion to the project, we could possibly implement a database system that allows for users to log in and sign up. We can then utilize the user login system and potentially create a leaderboard to motivate users to compete and explore numerous places around!
